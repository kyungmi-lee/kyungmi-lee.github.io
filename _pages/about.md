I'm a Postdoctoral Associate at the Research Laboratory of Electronics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), advised by Prof. Anantha P. Chandrakasan. 
I received my Ph.D. (2024) and S.M. (2020) degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT, and B.S. (2018) degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Seoul National University. 

My research focuses on the security and energy-efficiency of hardware systems for deep learning. 
During my Ph.D., I worked on security vulnerabilities affecting deep learning accelerators and developed hardware-friendly defenses.
My thesis has been selected for the MIT Microsystems Technology Laboratory (MTL) Doctroal Dissertation Seminar in Fall 2024. 
I received the Best Student Paper Award at IEEE International Workshop on Signal Processing Systems in 2021, the Doctoral Fellowship from Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies (2018-2023), the Siebel Scholars Class of 2020, and the MIT Presidential Fellowship in 2018.
